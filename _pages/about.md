Short Bio
======

I am a postdoc at [School of Cyber Science and Technology](https://icsr.zju.edu.cn/), Zhejiang University, working with Prof. Kui Ren and Prof. Zhongjie Ba. I am interested in using digital signal processing and AI technologies to solve security and privacy problems in the audio domain. 

I received my Ph.D. degree from [School of Computing and Communications](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/scc/), Lancaster University, Lancashire, UK, co-supervised by Prof. Utz Roedig and Prof. Jeff Yan. I received my M.Eng degree from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China and received my M.Sc degree from [Department of Electrical Engineering](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/), KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium. I received my B.Eng degree from [School of Electronic Engineering](https://see.bupt.edu.cn/en/), Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT).
